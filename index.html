<h1>The effect of poverty on Academic Achievement in children 4-10 years of age.</h1>

<p>
Everywhere we look, in all countries and times, there exists poverty. Maybe it is not as large in some countries as it is in others, or not as visible, but it is there. Additionally, in all countries and times, there are children. Children who may find themselves in poverty. These children endeavor to become educated citizens, but not enough of them successfully do.The result of this is that some of these children become stuck in a cycle of poverty through many generations, due to lack of an effective education. Whether it’s the life at home, or the school’s lack of funding, many schools in impoverished areas fail to provide their students with the necessary psychological and educational resources to succeed in the modern world.

Unfortunately, the people who raise a child in poverty are not the only factors which may have a toxic effect on the child’s psychological development.
 A low-income parent may have no other option besides residing in an old, cheap apartment. Many of these old apartments and homes 
 are still painted with lead-based paint, and as a result, “Infants and toddlers in old housing eat the sweet-tasting paint chips 
 and breathe the lead dust from deteriorating paint.”(Brooks-Gunn et al. 1997). Even at low levels of exposure, lead has been found
 to be harmful. Even a small increase over the CDC intervention threshold (10 µg/dL) is associated with a decrease in IQ. So, not on
 ly are children who grow up in impoverished families likely to be psychologically stunted, but 
they are likely to experience actual physiological issues as a result of lead poisoning which will last them their entire life.
