<h5>An Essay on the Effects of Poverty on Academic Achievement in Children</h5>
<p>
Everywhere we look, in all countries and times, there exists poverty. Maybe it is not as large in some countries as it is in others, or not as visible, but it is there. Additionally, in all countries and times, there are children. Children who may find themselves in poverty. These children endeavor to become educated citizens, but not enough of them successfully do.The result of this is that some of these children become stuck in a cycle of poverty through many generations, due to lack of an effective education. Whether it’s the life at home, or the school’s lack of funding, many schools in impoverished areas fail to provide their students with the necessary psychological and educational resources to succeed in the modern world.
<br><br>
For an impoverished child, the life at home differs significantly from the life at home of a middle class child. One example, is the result of financial conflict between two parents. As a result of such conflicts, the mother’s harshness towards her children increases and undermines the self-confidence and achievement of an adolescent (Duncan, et al. 1998).One can see how, if such harshness persists, the adolescent may become discouraged from succeeding in school, whether it is due to low self-confidence or lack of any reward from the mother. That is if  the child has both parents working and/or present. Statistically, poorer families are more likely to be headed by a single young parent, who him/herself is uneducated, unemployed, and has low earning potential (Brooks-Gunn et al. 1997).Also, an uneducated parent is less likely to provide an intellectually stimulating and supportive childhood for their child than one who is educated. From this, we can glean that a child growing up in a low-income household is likely to have a harsher single parent, and no 2nd parent to turn to for support. Possibly as a result of this constant neglect and low self-confidence, children living below the poverty threshold are 1.3 times as likely as non-poor children to experience learning disabilities and developmental delays (Brooks-Gunn et al. 1997).
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the people who raise a child in poverty are not the only factors which may have a toxic effect on the child’s psychological development. A low-income parent may have no other option besides residing in an old, cheap apartment. Many of these old apartments and homes are still painted with lead-based paint, and as a result, “Infants and toddlers in old housing eat the sweet-tasting paint chips and breathe the lead dust from deteriorating paint.”(Brooks-Gunn et al. 1997). Even at low levels of exposure, lead has been found to be harmful. Even a small increase over the CDC intervention threshold (10 µg/dL) is associated with a decrease in IQ. So, not only are children who grow up in impoverished families likely to be psychologically stunted, but they are likely to experience actual physiological issues as a result of lead poisoning which will last them their entire life.
<br><br>
In almost all cases, an impoverished child will find themselves being raised in a lower-class neighborhood which “fits” their socioeconomic status. A parent’s low income may also restrict the child in which schools they may attend, possibly limiting the child to only being able to attend schools which are nearby. Also, a student from a middle class neighborhood may have been culturally better prepared to navigate the school system than one from a lower class neighborhood, as the school system tends to lean towards middle-class culture. Schools located in low-income neighborhoods are less likely to receive the proper funding (Brown, Cynthia G. 2011) for their students and are more likely to be ill-equipped for teaching and providing proper resources for low-income students as a result. Also, once a student is in a lower-income school, even though they themselves may have been raised to be successful, peer pressure from other low-income students may force the student to want to “be like them”. In addition, schools which serve a “higher proportion of low-income students tend to have lower expenditure of nonfederal funds”. Collectively, all of these school factors combined create an unfavorable learning environment for the student in a school, and may result in lower-income children immediately being at a disadvantage to middle/upper class children before they even set foot into a school. In fact, low-income students are behind in vocabulary, math and reading achievement (Greenstone, Michael et al. 2011).In some cases, this results in their placement in lower-level classes which are not as intellectually challenging or competitive as others, which allows the students to become lazy and lack a significant work ethic for use later in college or in the workplace.
<br><br>
	All of these factors have a very significant and visible effect on academic achievement in impoverished children.From the common claim by geneticists that DNA accounts for 30-50 percent of our behaviour, we can see that 50-70 percent can be explained and modified by the environment (Jensen, Eric 2009). Very young children can easily be influenced by the effects of teen motherhood, depression, and inadequate health care.The resulting insecurity, a psychological deficiency which is detrimental to academic performance, results in children being unable to learn in and explore in a healthy manner, both of which are required for optimal brain development (Jensen, Eric 2009). When those children grow up and enter high school, due to their troubled upbringing, they will be more 	likely to display “ “Acting out” behaviours, Impatience and impulsivity, gaps in politeness and social graces, a more limited range of behavioural responses, inappropriate emotional responses, inappropriate emotional responses, and less empathy for others’ misfortunes” (Jensen, Eric 2009). It is important to keep in mind, though, that these deficits can be fought, and they are not a result of malicious intent on the students side, but are due to how the student was raised. Instead of condemning such behaviour, it is far more important to recognize and assist the student in changing it. Unfortunately, many experienced and high-quality teachers tend to avoid low-income neighborhoods and instead migrate to those schools with a lower percentage of low-income students (Brown, Cynthia G. et al.). As a result of this, many majority low-income schools do not have the resources nor the tools necessary to combat the psychological deficiencies resulting from a child being raised in a low-income state. Though there have been actions taken by the Department of Education to combat lack of funding in impoverished school districts, such as the passing of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) act, which included provisions applying to disadvantaged students, some of these pieces of legislation are not as effective as they genuinely need to be in order to eliminate the funding gap between low income (impoverished) and higher income (Middle/upper class) school districts.In particular, the Title I Comparability Requirement, which is a finance provision within the NCLB which requires that districts use state and local funds to provide comparable services to both Title I (At least 40% of a school’s students must be from low-income families for it to qualify as a “Title I” school) and non-Title I schools. Unfortunately, this requirement does not take into account teacher salaries, which are an effective measure of teacher experience and quality, which results in some districts being stuck with inexperienced teachers which are practically unable to provide the “comparable” services which are being provided by experienced teachers in higher-income non-Title 1 schools. While it is possible for an experienced teacher to hold a position teaching at a Title 1 school, there is close to no legislation available which will provide a significant benefit to a teacher who chooses to work at a Title 1 school. As a result, many experienced teachers are able to, and do, drift towards schools with lower percentage of low-income students.
<br><br>
	Though poverty has been a driving force for low educational achievement for many years, there still are things which can be done, legislation which can be passed, to either eliminate or reduce poverty’s influence on the academic achievement of children affected by it. Investments made in education have had a drastic effect on productivity increases, causing 25 percent productivity gains between 1915 and 1999 (Greenstone, Michael et al. 2011). Such gains have increased the amount of tax-paying workers in the U.S. and have resulted in other long-term beneficial effects on the U.S. economy.Though structural changes would be the most effective ways to change the current educational system to provide more assistance to needy students, such large changes would be practically inefficient and would take long periods of time. Instead, we can take a hint from innovative charter schools, which have been a cause of the largest student achievement gains among schools. On average, a student attending a KIPP middle school improved in terms of test scores by the equivalent of four extra months at a regular school (Greenstone, Michael et al. 2011). Unfortunately, researchers have had trouble deciding upon what variable in particular makes charter schools this efficient. It could be particularly strict disciplinary measures at one school, or classes on weekends on another, or an extended school day. Pure expenses per student, likewise, do not appear to be the lone factor in improved test scores. The budgetary costs of charter schools are within the same range as many public schools, with some charter schools even having a lower budget than many public ones (Greenstone, Michael et al. 2011).
<br><br>
	Everywhere we look, in all countries and times, there exists poverty. But poverty is not a requirement for existence. It can be fought, limited, and eliminated. Through government policy, new teaching strategies, and tactics which combat continued poverty at home, we can all make a difference. Though poverty does have a significant influence on academic achievement in children, through those tactics mentioned above, and careful application of the knowledge we have, its influence can be eventually eliminated.
